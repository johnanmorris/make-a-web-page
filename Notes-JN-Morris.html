<div class="intro">
	<p>
		In this Nano Degree, we are learning the basics
		of web programming, including HTML/CSS and Python. 
		The class will also teach you how to think like
		a programmer by utilizing specific critical thinking
		and problem-solving skills&mdash;including 
		techonological empathy (e.g., computers are stupid
		and will only do what you tell them to do).

<h1>Lesson 1.1: The Basics of the Web</h1>

<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>The Web</h2>

		<p>
			The web is essentially a collection of 
			documents. Most of these documents are HTML 
			documents, but there are also PDFs, image
			files, etc. A user uses a <strong>web browser</strong>
			on his or her computer to view the Internet.
			In order to do this, the user&rsquo;s computer
			must send a request with <strong>HTTP</strong>
			(hypertext transfer protocol) to <strong>servers</strong>
			which store the HTML pages. The Internet is
			just a collection of many servers connected
			together, interpreted through a web browser.
		</p>

		<p>
			HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup
			Language</strong>. An HTML document has three
			basic components:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>text</strong>, or the main content
				of a page;</li>
			<li><strong>markup</strong>, the code telling
				the computer what a page should look like;
				and</li>
			<li><strong>links to other pages</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>HTML Markup</h2>

		<p>
			The basic unit of HTML markup is the <strong>tag</strong>. 
			A tag is always surrounded by angle brackets
			(<span class="code">&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</span>).
			Most tags have an opening tag and a closing 
			tag. A closing tag has a forward slash after
			the first bracket (<span class="code">&lt;/&nbsp;&gt;</span>).
			Everything between tags is known as an <strong>element</strong>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Some tags have what is known as an <em>attribute</em>.
			An attribute is a property of an HTML element.
			For example, the <strong>anchor</strong> tag,
			used to create links (like <a href="http://www.google.com">
			this one to Google</a>), has an attribute
			known as <em>href</em>. So, a link would
			look like this:
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;a href="url"&gt;linktext&lt;/a&gt;</p>
		
		<p>
			Tags can have more than one attribute; for
			instance, the <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span>
			tag, used for linking to and displaying images,
			usually has two attributes, <em>src</em> 
			(for <em>source</em>) and <em>alt</em> (for
			<em>alternate</em>).
			The <strong>src</strong> tag is used to link
			to the url of the image, while <strong>alt</strong>
			displays text if a link to the image is broken
			or a page is being viewed by a blind person.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> 
			tag is a type known as a void tag. This simply
			means that there is no content (text) within
			the tag. Void tags do not need closing tags
			(and can be &ldquo;self-closed&rdquo; with
			a forward slash immediately before the final
			angle bracket). Another void tag is used for
			line breaks, <span class="code">&lt;br/&gt;</span>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Inline Tags vs. Block Tags</h2>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Inline tags</strong> are tags which
			occur within a text. Many common tags are
			inline tags, such as:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>line break: <span class="code">&lt;br/&gt;</span></li>
			<li>image: <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span></li>
			<li><em>italics</em>: <span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span></li>
			<li><strong>bold</strong>: <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span>
				or <span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			On the other hand, a <strong>block tag</strong>,
			is one that sections off an entire section
			of text, creating an invisible &ldquo;box&rdquo;
			around an element. The most common block tag
			is probably the paragraph, or 
			<span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Span and Div</h3>
		
		<p>
			The difference between inline and block tags
			can be illustrated by comparing the 
			<span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span> and 
			<span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> tags.
			Both tags are <strong>container</strong>
			tags&mdash;they surround an element in a certain
			style. However, <span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span>
			is an inline tag, existing within a line or
			block, while <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>
			is a block tag, creating a &ldquo;box&rdquo;
			or block around an element.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Anatomy of a Page</h2>
		
		<p>
			There are many tags, but all HTML pages have
			the following parts which make up the skeleton
			or backbone of a page:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span> : 
				tells you what the document type is</li>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> :
				starts and ends each HTML document</li>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> :
				This tag contains the <em>metadata</em>
				of a page. This can include the title
				(enclosed by <span class="code">&lt;title&gt;</span> 
				tags), links to any referenced CSS or 
				JavaScript pages, and the like.</li>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> :
				These tags enclose the main content of
				the page&mdash;all the text, images, and
				links within a page.</li>
		</ul>

	</div>

</div>

<h1>Lesson 1.2: Creating Structured Documents with HTML</h1>

<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Languages of the Web</h2>

		<p>
			When you write a webpage, you are using two
			basic languages, HTML and CSS:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>HTML</strong> provides the
				<em>structure</em> of a page&mdash;what
				the headings, paragraphs, links, and
				images are.</li>
			<li><strong>CSS</strong>, or Cascading Style
				Sheets, tells the browser how a page is
				styled: the font size and color of each
				element, the position of elements, borders,
				and so on.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>The Structure of an HTML Page</h2>
	
		<p>
			An HTML page can be conceptualized with a tree
			model, with elements branching out within or
			beneath other elements. For example, the
			paragraph you are reading right now is nested
			as follows:
		</p>
		
		<div class="indent"><strong>body</strong> &rarr;
			<strong>div</strong> &rarr; <strong>div</strong>
			&rarr; <strong>p</strong></div>
		
		<p>
			This is a simplified example, leaving out
			many parallel branches, but illustrates this
			nesting structure. You can view the structure
			of any webpage by using the &ldquo;Inspect
			Element&rdquo; tool in most browsers.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Elements as Boxes</h2>

		<p>
			The &ldquo;Inspect Element&rdquo; tool will
			also show you another feature of elements:
			they are all boxes. This is actually a useful
			feature of HTML and CSS, as it allows you to
			easily rearrange elements on a page. It also
			enables you to break down the design of a
			page into blocks, which has smaller blocks
			nested inside of it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Treating elements of a page as a gives you
			a convenient starting point for figuring out
			how to code a design. For example, this can
			help you find the best place for each div.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Lesson 1.3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h1>

<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>CSS</h2>

		<p>
			Along with HTML, CSS is one of the most common
			languages used in web development.
			<strong>CSS</strong> stands for Cascading
			Style Sheets. It&rsquo;s <em>cascading</em>
			because the styling rule of a parent element
			is applied to all its children
			(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">
			Source</a>). This is also known as inheritance. 
			If there is a more specific rule, though,
			then the styling of the parent element does
			not get passed down. For instance, if I wanted
			to make all text in a paragraph (i.e., in
			the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags)
			blue, all of the text would also be blue,
			whether it was bolded, italicized, or underlined.
			However, if I wrote a rule in CSS that made
			all underlined text the color red, then that
			rule would override the paragraph styling,
			because it&rsquo;s more specific.
		</p>

		<p>
			The syntax of CSS is a bit different than
			HTML, though some of the code is similar.
			It&rsquo;s basically composed of three parts:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>selector</strong>: The element
				of the page a particular style will apply
				to. This can be HTML (e.g., p, em, ul),
				or a user-defined <em>class</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>property:</strong> This tells
				the browser what particular aspect of
				the selector is being styles (e.g., text
				size, color, etc.).</li>
			<li>value: The value of a given property.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The basic template for CSS, then, would look
			like this:
		</p>
		
		<div class="code">
			h2 {<br/>
			<span class="indent">font-family: Georgia,
				serif;</span><br/>
			}
		</div>
		
		<p>
			If I wanted to style a class, though, it
			would look more like this:
		</p>
		
		<p class="code">.class {property: value;}</p>
		
		<p>
			Note: If you write CSS all in one line like
			this, the computer can still read it. However,
			in other to make it easier for humans to read,
			it&rsquo;s recommended to indent, by placing
			each property and value on its own line.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Use CSS to Avoid Repetition</h2>
	
		<p>
			When doing any coding, one of the primary
			goals is to prevent repetition. Using selectors
			and classes in CSS allows you to avoid repetition.
		</p>

		<p>
			Say you wanted to emphasize certain paragraphs
			by changing the font face, size, and color.
			If I were just working with HTML, I would
			have to put something like this in front of
			each paragraph, each time you changed these
			values:
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;font face="Helvetica" color="red" size="15"&gt;</p>

		<p>
			Then, to get the style of the normal paragraphs,
			I would have to put in the &lt;font&gt; HTML
			again, by writing something like this:
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;font face="Georgia" color="black" size="10"&gt;</p>

		<p>
			If I had to change a lot of paragraphs this
			way, it would get very tedious, I&rsquo;d
			have to write a lot more code, and I might
			be prone to making more mistakes.
		</p>

		<p>
			With CSS, though, I can create a class in a
			single stylesheet, and use that stylesheet
			over several webpages (maybe even an entire
			website). In this case, I could do something
			like this:
		</p>
		
		<p class="code">
			.bigred {<br/>
			<span class="indent">font-family: Helvetica,
				sans-serif;</span><br/>
			<span class="indent">size: 20px;</span><br/>
			<span class="indent">color: red;</span><br/>
			}
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, any time I wanted to use this style,
			I can give the paragraph the class "bigred":
		</p>
	
		<p class="code">&lt;p class="bigred"&gt;This is
			an emphasized paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

		<p>
			Using classes in CSS also makes it easy to
			make changes to a design&mdash;so for example,
			if I decided I wanted to indent the "bigred"
			class, I could just change the class once in
			the CSS file, rather than trying to find each
			instance in the HTML.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>CSS and the Box Model</h2>
		
		<p>
			As stated previously, everything on the web
			is a box. Well, a page element is not just
			a simple box&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bit more
			complicated than that! For any given element,
			a total of three other boxes surround it.
			Starting from the inside and working out, an
			element is composed of each of the following:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Content:</strong> The text or
				image</li>
			<li><strong>Padding:</strong> Acts as a buffer
				around the content</li>
			<li><strong>Border:</strong> Surrounds the
				content and image</li>
			<li><strong>Margin:</strong> Clears an area
				around the border</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Each of these elements can be controlled 
			independently of the other in HTML. However,
			that gets complicated quickly. To simplify
			matters, the following CSS can be used:
		</p>

		<p class="code">*{box-sizing: border-box;}</p>
		
		<p>With this code, the overall width of a box is
			not affected by changes	to the padding and
			border. This code does not take the margin
			into account. To make this work on older 
			browsers, additional code is needed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another useful bit of CSS makes divs appear
			next to each other, rather than take up the
			entire width of the page. To do this, place
			the following declaration in the relevant 
			selectors:
		</p>

		<div class="code">display: flex;</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Process</h2>
	
		<p>
			Here are the basic steps of the web design
			process:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Look for natural boxes.</li>
			<li>Find styles and semantic elements that 
				can be repeated.</li>
			<li>Write HTML.</li>
			<li>Write CSS, and apply styles starting at
				the biggest elements and working down
				the the smallest ones.</li>
			<li>Fix things as you go along by continuously
				looking at how your changes affect the
				design.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Lesson 2.1: Introduction to Serious Programming</h1>

<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>What is Programming?</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Programming</strong> is the process
			of writing code to tell a computer what to
			do. Programs are what allow computers to be
			arguably our most powerful and versatile
			machines: if we can write instructions for
			it, we can make a computer do just about 
			anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			These instructions, called a <strong>program</strong>,
			are written using a specific set of formal 
			rules, known as a <strong>programming
			language</strong>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Programming vs. Natural Languages</h2>

		<p>
			Two features of natural languages make them
			unsuitable for writing code:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				They are <strong>ambiguous</strong>. This
				occurs not only on a lexical level (e.g.,
				the word &ldquo;cleave&rdquo; has two 
				contradictory meanings), but at other
				levels as well. Since computers are stupid,
				and only do what we tell them to do,
				anyone writing code needs to avoid this
				sort of ambiguity.
			</li>
			<li>
				They are <strong>verbose</strong>. It 
				takes much more text (and therefore much
				more data) to explain instructions in
				plain English (or Greek, or Japanese, or
				Hindi) what can be explained in a few
				spare lines in code.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			There are a few similarities between natural
			languages and computer languages, though.
			Like English, a programming language has a
			set of rules which make up its 
			<strong>grammar</strong>, and a &ldquo;phrase&rdquo;
			has a specific syntax that it must follow.
			Programming languages have far fewer of these
			rules, and a computer won&rsquo;t understand
			imperfect syntax (which is unlike the way a
			human might understand the imperfect grammar
			of a non-native speaker or a three-year-old
			child.)
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Python</h2>

		<p>
			There are many, many programming languages.
			One of the most popular is known as Python.
			Python has many syntactical rules. An example
			is this set of rules for arthimetic expressions:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Expression &rarr; Expression Operator 
				Expression</li>
			<li>Expression &rarr; Number</li>
			<li>Expression &rarr; (Expression)</li>
			<li>Operator &rarr; +, *, etc.</li>
			<li>Number &rarr; 0, 1, 2, 3...</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This set of rules illustrates an important
			feature of programming rules known as 
			<strong>recursion</strong>. In this case, it 
			means that we can have a long string of arthimetic 
			functions (in theory, an infinite length) 
			because the <strong>expression</strong> exists
			on both sides of the rule.
		</p>

		<p>
			In actual Python, a valid line of arithmetic
			code could look something like this:
		</p>

		<p class="code">print 5 * 4 + (5 * (3 + 2))</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Lesson 2.2: Variables and Strings</h1>
<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Variables</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Variables</strong> are a way to label
			a value and store it for future use. They
			work similarly to variables in algebra, in
			that they can stand in for a value in all
			sorts of computations.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Variables are created with <strong>assignment 
			statements</strong>, which look like this:
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;name&gt; = &lt;expression&gt;</p>

		<p>
			For example, <span class="code">speed_of_light = 299792458</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Assignment statements can reference other
			variables, as long as the variable has already
			been assigned:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			speed_of_light = 29979458<br/>
			billionth = 1.0 / 1000000000<br/>
			nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100<br/>
			print nanostick<br/>
			29.9792458
		</div>

		<p>(Examples taken from class video.)</p>

		<p>
			You can also change the value of a variable
			and it will update. This allows you to do 
			things like:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			days = 31<br/>
			days = days - 1
		</p>

		<p>
			This last statement illustrates the difference
			between an assignment statement and an algebraic
			formula, however. The equal sign (=) does
			not mean equal. Rather, it means &ldquo;is
			assigned to&rdquo;. If it worked exactly like
			an equal sign, the statement <span class="code">
			days = days - 1</span> wouldn&rsquo;t work
			because there would be no way to evaluate it.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, in Python, as long as the variable 
			<span class="code">days</span> is defined,
			then <span class="code">days = days - 1</span>
			can return a value (in our case, 30).
		</p>

		<p>
			(On a related note, the code to the right of 
			the = is always read by the computer first.)
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Strings</h2>
		
		<p>
			If I want to manipulate something other than
			a number, I have to use strings. A <strong>string</strong>
			is a sequence of characters surrounded by
			either single or double quotes&mdash;either
			is fine, as long as they are closed with the
			same type of quotation mark.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			You can add strings together: <span class="code">'stop'
			+ 's'</span>. This is known as <strong>concatenation</strong>.
			You cannot, however, add strings and integers 
			together; however, it is possible to multiply
			strings.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Indexing Strings</h3>

		<p>
			Indexing is a way to find out what character
			is in a given position of the string. This
			is done with the following syntax:
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;string&gt;[&lt;expression&gt;]</p>
		<p>The &lt;expression&gt; is the number of a
			position of the string. Three important points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The count starts with 0,</li>
			<li>You can use negative numbers to count
				from the end of a string, and</li>
			<li>If you try to index a number larger than
				the length of the string, an error will
				be returned.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>So, for example:</p>

		<p class="code">
			name = "Cheryl"<br/>
			print name[0]<br/>
			C<br/>
			print name[-2]<br/>
			y</br>
			print name[7]<br/>
			IndexError: string index out of range</br>
		</p>
	
		<h3>Sub-Sequences</h3>
	
		<p>
			Similar to index, this pulls a range of sub-strings
			from within a larger string. The syntax is 
			only slightly different: 
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;string&gt;[&lt;expression&gt;:&lt;expression&gt;]</p>
		
		<p>This means that you want to reference the bit
			of the string from the first position (left 
			of the colon) up to and <strong>not</strong>
			including the part of the string of the second
			position (right of the colon).
		</p>

		<p>
			Using the example variable <span class="code">name</span>
			from above:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			print name[1:3]<br/>
			he<br/>
			print name[1:5]<br/>
			hery<br/>
		</p>

		<p>
			Either side of the colon can be left blank.
			If the left side of the colon is blank, it
			means to start at the beginning of the string
			(i.e., position 0). If the right is blank,
			it means to end at the end of the string. 
			The latter is particularly useful if you
			don&rsquo;t know how long a string is (or
			don&rsquo;t want to count it) and you want
			the final bit of it.
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			print name[2:]<br/>
			eryl<br/>
			print name[:3]<br/>
			Che</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Finding Strings Within Strings</h2>

		<p>
			If I want to find the location of a string
			within a string, I use the following:
		</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;string&gt;.find(&lt;string&gt;)</p>
		
		<p>
			So for example, <span class="code">name.find("he")</span>
			would return the number 1, because it appears 
			at position 1.
		</p>

		<p>If I have a longer string, and want to find
			a string after a certain position, the syntax
			would be:</p>

		<p class="code">&lt;string&gt;.find(&lt;string&gt;,&lt;number&gt;)</p>

		<p>So, I could do something like this:</p>

		<p class="code">
			preamble = "We the People of the United States,
			in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish
			Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide
			for the common defence, promote the general
			Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty
			to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain
			and establish this Constitution for the United
			States of America."<br/>
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;preamble.find("the")
			<span class="comment">#This is a simple find.</span><br/>
			3<br/>
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;preamble.find("the", 3)
			<span class="comment">#This will return 3, 
				because it starts looking at 3, and finds
				"the"</span><br/>
			3<br/>
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;preamble.find("the", 4) 
			<span class="comment">#To find "the" after
				position 4</span><br/>
			17<br/>
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;preamble.find("spaceship")<br/>
			-1 <span class="comment">#When a string isn't
			found, -1 is returned</span>
		</p>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Functions</h2>

		<p>
			A <strong>function</strong>, also known as
			a <em>procedure</em>, is a piece of code that
			takes in an input to produce an output. The
			basic format of the code looks like this:</p>
		
		<p class="code">
			&lt;function&gt;(&lt;input&gt;,&lt;input&gt;):
		</p>

		<p>
			We have already looked at one kind of function,
			the <span class="code">find</span> function.
			Programmers are able to define their own
			functions, however, and often do.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Inputs and Outputs</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Inputs</strong>, also called <em>operands</em>
			or <em>arguments</em>, are what go between
			the parentheses of the function.
			<strong>Outputs</strong> are the result of
			running the function. In order to get an
			output, we need to write additional code to
			<em>use</em> the output. The simplest way to
			do this is with a <span class="code">print</span> 
			statement. In the example below, I have
			labeled the inputs and outputs:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			def pluralize(word): 
			<span class="comment">#defines the input</span><br/>
			<span class="indent">return word + "s"
				<span class="comment">#defines the 
					output</span></span>
				<br/>
				</br>
			print pluralize("cow") 
			<span class="comment">#"cow" is the 
			input</span><br/>
			cows <span class="comment">#This is the
			output</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			To define a function, two bits must be in
			the code:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="code">def</span> introduces 
				the name of the function and the type
				and number of inputs that function will
				take.</li>
			<li><span class="code">return</span> says
				what the output will be. Without it, we
				can&rsquo;t use any values that might be
				part of our input.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>How Functions Reduce Repetition</h2>

		<p>
			Functions are useful to programmers because,
			once defined, they can be used over and over
			again, no matter what the inputs.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For instance, in the previous example, we 
			<em>could</em> just use simple concatenation
			every time:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;print "cow" + "s"<br/>
			cows<br/>
			&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;print "duck" + "s"<br/>
			ducks
		</p>

		<p>
			But it would be a waste of time, because for
			the most part, writing a simple rule (or 
			<em>function</em>) would let us pluralize
			any input. (Of course, English is tricky,
			and this function by itself would not always
			produce valid words; but that is what if
			statements are for!)
		</p>
	</div>

</div>

<h1>Lesson 2.4: Control Flow and Loops: If and While</h1>
<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>If Statements and Comparisons</h2>
	
		<p>
			One of the key features of an <strong>if 
			statement</strong> is that is uses comparisons.
			<strong>Comparisons</strong> look like the
			syntax for simple arithmetic, except that:		
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The operators are
				<span class="code">&lt;</span>,
				<span class="code">&gt;</span>,
				<span class="code">!=</span>
				(does not equal), or <span class="code">==</span>
				(equals). Note that ask whether something
				<em>equals</em> something else, two equal
				signs are needed, to differentiate this
				from an assignment statement.</li>
			<li>The output of a comparison is a 
				<strong>Boolean value</strong>, i.e.,
				True or False.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Thus, a simple if statement could look something
			like this:
		</p>
		
		<p class="code">
			if 50 &lt; 20:<br/>
			<span class="indent">print "This is true!"</span><br/>
			else:<br/>
			<span class="indent">print "This is false!"</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			This would, of course, print "This is false!"
		</p>

		<p>
			I have now learned the four basic elements
			of programming&mdash;arithmetic, comparisons,
			procedures/functions, and if statements.
			While it is possible to build any computer
			program using only these tools, programming
			languages have more sophisticated ways to do
			tasks more efficiently.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>While Loops</h2>
		
		<p>
			While loops are used to repeat a certain
			action as long as (i.e., <em>while</em>) a
			certain condition is true. The basic syntax
			for a while loop is:
		</p>
		
		<p class=:"code">
			while &lt;Test Expression&gt;:<br/>
			<span class="indent">&lt;Block&gt;</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, it&rsquo;s possible to have
			something like this:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			i = 0<br/>
			while i &lt; 10:<br/>
			<span class="indent">print i</span><br/>
			<span class="indent">i = i + 1</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			This loop basically starts with 0 and
			counts until in reaches 9; It will print the
			numbers 0&ndash;9.
		</p>

		<p>
			While loops are similar to if statements,
			except that they can run any number
			of times&mdash;even infinitely (though that
			is rarely, if ever, the programmer&rsquo;s
			intention).
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Breaks</h2>

		<p>
			Sometimes, you need to interrupt a while loop.
			To do this, you would use a <strong>break</strong>.
			If a break test is true, it skips the rest
			of the while loop and runs the code after.
			For example:
		</p>
		
		<p class="code">
			i = 1<br/>
			while True:<br/>
			<span class="indent">if i &gt; n:</span><br/>
			<span class="indent"><span class="indent">break</span></span><br/>
			<span class="indent">print i</span><br/>
			<span class="indent">i = i + 1</span>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> The above is only
			illustrative and should <em>not</em> be used, 
			as there is a simpler way to do the same 
			thing, namely:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			i = 1<br/>
			while i &lt; n:<br/>
			<span class="indent">print i</span></br>
			<span class="indent">i = i + 1</span>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Lesson 2.5: Debugging</h1>
<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Bugs</h2>

		<p>
			Errors in computer code are known as
			<strong>bugs</strong>. Every programmer
			produces them&mdash;they&rsquo;re unavoidable.
			It is best to learn strategies for getting
			rid of bugs, in a process known as
			debugging.
		</p>

		<p>
			Bugs come in two basic flavors: those
			that cause an error message when the code
			is run, and those that do not cause an
			error message, but the code doesn&rsquo;t
			behave as expected. Each type has its own
			strategies for debugging.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Error Messages</h2>

		<p>
			An error message has two key parts that
			can help us identify the problem:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Traceback</strong>: This tells
				you the line number and function that
				an error is found.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>TypeError</strong>: Explains
				the nature of the error.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>No Error Message</h2>

		<p>
			If there is no error message, but the code
			is not doing what you want, it is a bit
			trickier to debug. But there are things you
			can try. One of the simplest ways to debug
			these is to try placing print statements after
			parts of a function. This lets you see what
			they do on their own.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Version Control</h2>

		<p>
			If you are trying to figure out a piece of
			code, don&rsquo;t just delete buggy code.
			It may be better than what you try next, and
			it can be more frustrating to lose better
			code. Instead, comment out code you are trying.
			In Python, we do that by placing a hash (#)
			at the beginning of the line. This keeps a
			record of ideas. You can always delete old
			code when you complete it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Professional programmers have more sophisticated
			methods for version control (though they use
			this method, too), for example GitHub. Keeping
			older versions is extremely useful, because if
			future changes break the code too much, you
			can always go back to older code that you
			have saved. 
		</p>
	</div>
</div>


<h1>Lesson 2.6: Structured Data: Lists &amp; For Loops</h1>
<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Strings vs. Lists</h2>

		<p>
			A string is simply a sequence of characters,
			as we saw before. For instance:
		</p>
		
		<p class="code">
			vowel = "aeiou"<br/>
			s[0]<br/>
			'a'<br/>
			s[2:4]<br/>
			'io'
		</p>

		<p>
			A <strong>list</strong> is a sequence, too,
			but, unlike string, they can be made up of
			anything. The basic syntax is:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			&lt;list&gt;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; [&lt;Expression&gt;,
			&lt;Expression&gt; ...]
		</p>

		<p>
			To find a specific expression in a list, it
			is similar to finding a specific character
			in a string; however, the output is somewhat
			different:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']<br/>
			vowel[0]<br/>
			'a'<br/>
			vowel[2:4]<br/>
			['i', 'o']
		</p>

		<p>
			List elements can be strings, numbers, or
			even lists inside of lists (nested lists):
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			birthMonth = [['Noelle', 1], ['Angela', 6],<br/>
			<span class="indent">['Randy', 10], ['Cheryl',
				3]]</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			To index within a nested list, the syntax is:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			print birthMonth[2][0]<br/>
			'Randy'
		</p>

		<p>
			Two features of lists allow for the creation
			of more structured data: mutation and aliasing.
		</p>

		<h3>Mutation</h3>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Mutation</strong> involves changing
			an element of a list.
		</p>
		
		<p class ="code">
			vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'o']<br/>
			vowel[4] = 'u'<br/>
			print vowel<br/>
			['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
		</p>

		<h3>Aliasing</h3>

		<p>
			<strong>Aliasing</strong> is a way of setting
			up variables to refer to the same object. So,
			for instance:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			q = vowel<br/>
			q[1]
			'e'
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>List Operations</h2>

		<p>
			There are several operations that can be
			performed on lists:
		</p>

		<h3>Append</h3>

		<p>
			This adds an expression to the end of the
			list.
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			vowel.append("y")<br/>
			print vowel<br/>
			['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']<br/>
		</p>

		<h3>Plus</h3>

		<p>
			This adds the contents of lists together:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			[0,1] + [2,3]<br/>
			[0, 1, 2, 3]
		</p>

		<p>
			Append and plus differ in how they behave.
			If you append a list to another list, it will
			treat the appended list as its own entity;
			i.e., it will be a nested list inside a list.
			But adding two lists together essentially
			concatenates the list. For example:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			a = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>
			b = [5, 6, 7, 8]<br/>
			c = [9, 0]<br/>
			d = a + b + c<br/>
			print d<br/>
			[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
		</p>

		<p>
			However, if I use append instead:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			a.append(b)<br/>
			print a<br/>
			[1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6, 7, 8]]
		</p>
	
		<h3>Length (len)</h3>
	
		<p>
			The length operator returns the number of
			items in a list.
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			len([0,1])<br/>
			2<br/>
			len(['a', ['b', c]])<br/>
			2
		</p>

		<p>
			This can also be used on strings; e.g.:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			len("Brandon")<br/>
			7
		</p>

		<h3>Index</h3>

		<p class="code">
			&lt;list&gt;.index(&lt;value&lt;)
		</p>

		<p>If the &lt;value&gt; is in the list, index
			returns the first position where the value
			is found. Otherwise, it produces an error.
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			rainbow = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green",
			"blue", "indigo", "violet"]<br/>
			print rainbow.index("red")<br/>
			0<br/>
			print rainbow.index("white")<br/>
			ValueError: 'white' is not in list
		</p>

		<h3>In</h3>

		<p class="code">
			&lt;value&gt; in &lt;list&gt;
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>In</strong> returns <span class="code">True</span> if
			value is in list, <span class="code">False</span>
			if it is not.
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			"red" in rainbow<br/>
			True<br/>
			"white" in rainbow<br/>
			False
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Loops on Lists</h2>

		<p>
			It&rsquo;s possible to use while loops on
			lists, e.g.:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			def print_all_elements(p):<br/>
			<span class="indent">while i &lt; len(p)</span><br/>
			<span class="indent"><span class="indent">
				print p[i]</span></span><br/>
			<span class="indent"><span class="indent">i = i + 1</span></span><br/>
		</p>

		<p>
			However, <strong>for loops</strong> make this
			simpler. The syntax for a for loop is:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			for &lt;name&gt; in &lt;list&gt;:<br/>
			<span class="indent">&lt;block&gt;</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			So the while loop above could be rewritten
			as:
		</p>

		<p class="code">
			def print_all_elements(p):<br/>
			<span class="indent">for e in p:</span><br/>
			<span class="indent"><span class="indent">
				print e</span></span>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>


<h1>Lesson 2.7: How to Solve Problems</h1>

<div class="lesson">

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Steps</h2>

		<ol start="0">
			<li>Don&rsquo;t Panic!</li>
			<li>Determine the inputs</li>
			<li>Determine the outputs</li>
			<li>Work through examples by hand</li>
			<li>Find the simple mechanical solution</li>
			<li>Develop incrementally and <em>test</em>
				as you go</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Understand the Problem</h2>

		<p>
			Understanding the problem means determining
			what both the inputs (1) and outputs (2) are,
			as well as the relationship between the two.
		</p>

		<p class="indent">input &rarr; PROCEDURE &rarr;
		output</p>

		<p>
			It&rsquo;s pretty hard to write a single
			line of code if you don&rsquo;t know all
			of the pieces involved. Worse, if you dive
			in without a complete understanding, you are
			more prone to introducing errors into your
			code. So, take the time to sketch out the
			problem and its components.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Work Through Examples</h2>
		
		<p>
			Before you write a line of code, you have to 
			determine how you as a human would solve a
			problem. For example, to take a very simple
			problem, if I were to write a program that
			returned the average of a list of numbers,
			I would first have to figure out the math
			involved; namely, the sum of all numbers in
			a set divided by the number of list items
			(in other words, divided by the length of
			the list).
		</p>

		<p>
			For something this simple, this may seem
			like a no-brainer, but working through a
			problem first is essential when trying to
			write code for a more complex problem. 
			(For these more complex problems, sometimes
			writing them in &ldquo;pseudocode&rdquo;
			helps.) The idea is to break a problem down
			into smaller bits, and therefore write your
			code in smaller, easier to understand bits.
			This not only makes the problem easier to
			understand, it reduces the amount of time
			spent debugging a program, as you are
			continuously writing and testing, writing
			and testing.
