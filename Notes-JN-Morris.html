<div class="intro">
	<p>In this Nano Degree, we are learning the basics of web programming,
		including HTML/CSS and Python. The class will also teach you how to
		think like a programmer by utilizing specific critical thinking and
		problem-solving skills&mdash;including techonological empathy (e.g.,
		computers are stupid and will only do what you tell them to do).</p>

<h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web</h1>
<div class="lesson">
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>The Web</h2>
		<p>The web is essentially a collection of documents. Most of these
			documents are HTML documents (but there are also PDFs, image 
			files, etc). A user uses a <strong>web browser</strong> on his
			or her computer to view the Internet. In order to do this, the
			user&rsquo;s computer must send a request with <strong>HTTP</strong>
			(hypertext transfer protocol) to <strong>servers</strong> which
			store the HTML pages. The Internet is just a collection of many 
			servers connected together, interpreted through a web browser.</p>
			<p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.
				An HTML document has three basic components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>text</strong>, or the main content of a page;</li>
				<li><strong>markup</strong>, the code telling the computer 
					what a page should look like; and</li>
				<li><strong>links to other pages</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>HTML Markup</h2>
		<p>The basic unit of HTML markup is the <strong>tag</strong>. A tag
			is always surrounded by angle brackets
			(<span class="code">&lt; &gt;</span>). Most tags have an opening
			tag and a closing tag. A closing tag has a forward slash after the
			first bracket (<span class="code">&lt;/&nbsp;&gt;</span>). Everything between tags is known as an 
			<strong>element</strong>.</p>
		<p>Some tags have what is known as an <em>attribute</em>. An
			attribute is a property of an HTML element. For example, the
			<strong>anchor</strong> tag, used to create links (like 
			<a href="http://www.google.com">this one to Google</a>), has an
			attribute known as <em>href</em>. So, a link would look like this:</p>
			<div class="code">&lt;a href="url"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;</div>
		<p>Tags can have more than one attribute; for instance, the
			<span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag, used for linking to and
			displaying images, usually has two attributes, <em>src</em>
			(for <em>source</em>) and <em>alt</em> (for <em>alternate</em>).
			The <strong>src</strong> tag is used to link to the url of the
			image, while <strong>alt</strong> displays text if a link to
			the image is broken or a page is being viewed by a blind person.</p>
		<p>The <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag is a type known as a void
			tag. This simply means that there is no content (text) within
			the tag. Void tags do not need closing tags (and can be
			&ldquo;self-closed&rdquo; with a forward slash immediately
			before the final angle bracket). Another void tag is used for
			line breaks, <span class="code">&lt;br/&gt;</span>.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Inline Tags vs. Block Tags</h2>
		<p><strong>Inline tags</strong> are tags which occur within a text.
			Many common tags are inline tags, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>line break: <span class="code">&lt;br/&gt;</span></li>
			<li>image: <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span></li>
			<li><em>italics</em>: <span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span></li>
			<li><strong>bold</strong>: <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span> or 
				<span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span>.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>On the other hand, a <strong>block tag</strong>, is one that
			sections off an entire section of text, creating an invisible
			&ldquo;box&rdquo; around an element. The most common block tag
			is probably the paragraph, or <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>.</p>
		<h3>Span and Div</h3>
		<p>The difference between inline and block tags can be illustrated
			by comparing the <span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span> and 
			<span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> tags. Both tags are 
			<strong>container</strong> tags&mdash;they surround an element
			in a certain style. However, <span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span>
			is an inline tag, existing within a line or block, while
			<span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> is a block tag, creating a 
			&ldquo;box&rdquo; or block around an element.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Anatomy of a Page</h2>
		<p>There are many tags, but all HTML pages have the following parts
			which make up the skeleton or backbone of a page:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span> : tells you what
				the document type is</li>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> : starts and ends each
				HTML document</li>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> : This tag contains the
				<em>metadata</em> of a page. This can include the title
				(enclosed by <span class="code">&lt;title&gt;</span> tags), links
				to any referenced CSS or JavaScript pages, and the like.</li>
			<li><span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> : These tags enclose the 
				main content of the page&mdash;all the text, images, and
				links within a page.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Lesson 2: Creating Structured Documents with HTML</h1>
<div class="lesson">
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Languages of the Web</h2>
		<p>When you write a webpage, you are using two basic languages, HTML and
			CSS:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HTML</strong> provides the <em>structure</em> of a
				page&mdash;what the headings, paragraphs, links, and images
				are.</li>
			<li><strong>CSS</strong>, or Cascading Style Sheets, tells the
				browser how a page is styled: the font size and color of each
				element, the position of elements, borders, and so on.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2>The Structure of an HTML Page</h2>
		<p>An HTML page can be conceptualized with a tree model, with elements
			branching out within or beneath other elements. For example, the
			paragraph you are reading right now is nested as follows:</p>
		<div class="indent"><strong>body</strong> &rarr; <strong>div</strong> &rarr;
			<strong>div</strong> &rarr; <strong>p</strong></div>
		<p>This is a simplified example, leaving out many parallel branches, but 
			illustrates this nesting structure. You can view the structure of 
			any webpage by using the &ldquo;Inspect Element&rdquo; tool in most
			browsers.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Elements as Boxes</h2>
		<p>The &ldquo;Inspect Element&rdquo; tool will also show you another
			feature of elements: they are all boxes. This is actually a useful
			feature of HTML and CSS, as it allows you to easily rearrange elements
			on a page. It also enables you to break down the design of a a page 
			into blocks, which has smaller blocks nested inside of it.</p>
		<p>Treating elements of a page as a gives you a convenient starting point
			for figuring out how to code a design. For example, this can help you
			find the best place for each div.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h1>
<div class="lesson">
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>CSS</h2>
		<p>Along with HTML, CSS is one of the most common languages used in web
			development. <strong>CSS</strong> stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
			It&rsquo;s <em>cascading</em> because the styling rule of a parent
			element is applied to all its children (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">Source</a>).
			This is also known as inheritance. If there is a more specific rule,
			though, then the styling of the parent element does not get passed 
			down. For instance, if I wanted to make all text in a paragraph 
			(i.e., in the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags) blue, all of
			the text would also be blue, whether it was bolded, italicized, or
			underlined. However, if I wrote a rule in CSS that made all underlined
			text the color red, then that rule would override the paragraph styling,
			because it&rsquo;s more specific.</p>
		<p>The syntax of CSS is a bit different than HTMl, though some of the code
			is similar. It's basically composed of three parts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>selector</strong>: The element of the page a particular
			style will apply to. This can be HTML (e.g., p, em, ul), or a user-defined
			<em>class</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>property:</strong> This tells the browser what particular 
				aspect of the selector is being styles (e.g., text size, color, etc.).</li>
			<li>value: The value of a given property.</li></ul>
		<p>The basic template for CSS, then, would look like this:</p>
			<div class="code">h2 {<br/>
				<span class="indent">font-family: Georgia, serif;</span><br/>
			}</div>
		<p>If I wanted to style a class, though, it would look more like this:</p>
			<div class="code">.class {property: value;}</div>
		<p>Note: If you write CSS all in one line like this, the computer can still
			read it. However, in other to make it easier for humans to read, it&rsquo;s
			recommended to indent, by placing each property and value on its own
			line.</p>
		</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Use CSS to Avoid Repetition</h2>
		<p>When doing any coding, one of the primary goals is to prevent repetition.
			Using selectors and classes in CSS allows you to avoid repetition.</p>
		<p>Say you wanted to emphasize certain paragraphs by changing the font face,
			size, and color. If I were just working with HTML, I would have to put
			something like this in front of each paragraph, each time you changed
			these values:</p>
			<div class="code">&lt;font face="Helvetica" color="red" size="15"&gt;</div>

		<p>Then, to get the style of the normal paragraphs, I would have to put in
			the &lt;font&gt; HTML again, by writing something like this:</p>

			<div class="code">&lt;font face="Georgia" color="black" size="10"&gt;</div>

		<p>If I had to change a lot of paragraphs this way, it would get very
			tedious, I&rsquo;d have to write a lot more code, and I might be prone
			to making more mistakes.</p>
		<p>With CSS, though, I can create a class in a single stylesheet, and use
			that stylesheet over several webpages (maybe even an entire website)
			In this case, I could do something like this:</p>
			<div class="code">.bigred {<br/>
				<span class="indent">font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;</span><br/>
				<span class="indent">size: 20px;</span><br/>
				<span class="indent">color: red;</span><br/>
				}</div>

		<p>Then, any time I wanted to use this style, I can give the paragraph the
			class "bigred":</p>
			<div class="code">&lt;p class="bigred"&gt;This is an emphasized paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

		<p>Using classes in CSS also makes it easy to make changes to a design&mdash;so
			for example, if I decided I wanted to indent the "bigred" class, I could
			just change the class once in the CSS file, rather than trying to find
			each instance in the HTML.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>CSS and the Box Model</h2>
		<p>As stated previously, everything on the web is a box. Well, a page element 
			is not just a simple box&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than
			that! For any given element, a total of three other boxes surround it.
			Starting from the inside and working out, an element is composed of each
			of the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Content:</strong> The text or image</li>
			<li><strong>Padding:</strong> Acts as a buffer around the content</li>
			<li><strong>Border:</strong> Surrounds the content and image</li>
			<li><strong>Margin:</strong> Clears an area around the border</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each of these elements can be controlled independently of the other in
			HTML. However, that gets complicated quickly. To simplify matters, the
			following CSS can be used:</p>
			<div>*{box-sizing: border-box;}</div>
			<p>With this code, the overall width of a box is not affected by changes
				to the padding and border. This code does not take the margin into
				account. To make this work on older browsers, additional code is
				needed.</p>
			<p>Another useful bit of CSS makes divs appear next to each other, rather
				than take up the entire width of the page. To do this, place the
				following declaration in the relevant selectors:</p>
				<div class="code">display: flex;</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="concept">
		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>Here are the basic steps of the web design process:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Look for natural boxes.</li>
			<li>Find styles and semantic elements that can be repeated.</li>
			<li>Write HTML.</li>
			<li>Write CSS, and apply styles starting at the biggest elements and
				working down the the smallest ones.</li>
			<li>Fix things as you go along by continuously looking at how your changes
				affect the design.</li>
		</ol>
